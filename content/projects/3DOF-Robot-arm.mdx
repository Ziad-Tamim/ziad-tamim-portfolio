This project involved the design and construction of a 3DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robot arm, which was created from scratch for educational purposes. The arm's structure was 3D-printed, and it was controlled using an Arduino microcontroller programmed in C Language. The primary focus of this project was to learn about robotic arm manipulation, electronics, and embedded programming.

## Project Overview

The goal was to gain hands-on experience with **CAD design**, **3D printing**, **electronics**, and **embedded control systems**. The robotic arm was designed with three degrees of freedom, allowing basic movements for tasks like pick and place. In this initial phase, the arm is controlled using simple PWM signals, and no inverse kinematics or automation is applied yet.

This foundational version sets the stage for future development. Upcoming iterations of the project will explore:
- **Inverse kinematics** to control the arm using Cartesian coordinates  
- **Computer vision** and **machine learning** to enable object tracking or intelligent task execution  
- Potential integration with **deep learning** models for advanced gesture recognition or automation

## Components Used

- **Arduino Mega**: The brain of the robot arm, responsible for processing inputs and controlling the motors.
- **Servo Motors**: Used to provide the necessary movement for the arm's joints.
- **3D-Printed Structure**: The arm's body was designed and printed using a 3D printer, allowing for customization and flexibility in design.
- **Power Supply**: A reliable power source to ensure the servo motors and Arduino function correctly.
- **Jumper Wires**: Used for connecting the components together.
- **Breadboard**: A prototyping board used for building the circuit without soldering.
