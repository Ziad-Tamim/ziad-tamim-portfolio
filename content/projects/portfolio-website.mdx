## Overview
I built this portfolio to present my AI and web‑development work in a clean, organized way—combining a project gallery, 
resume, and blog into one cohesive site. My aim was to balance simplicity with functionality: visitors can quickly find what 
they need, whether that’s a deep‑dive article or an overview of my most recent projects.

## Design Principles
- Content‑First: Prioritize readability and clear hierarchy over decorative elements.
- Accessibility: Support keyboard navigation, proper contrast ratios, and semantic HTML for screen readers.
- Responsiveness: Ensure layouts adapt smoothly from mobile screens to wide desktop displays.
- User Choice: Provide both light and dark themes to suit different viewing preferences.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 & TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for utility‑first styling
- MDX (via next‑mdx‑remote) for blog and project content
- Resend for newsletter sign‑ups
- Vercel & GitHub for CI/CD and hosting
- Additional Libraries:
    - shadcn/ui (accessible components)
    - react‑hook‑form + zod (form handling & validation)
    - Lucide Icons

## Core Features
1. Blog System
 - Write posts in MDX with embedded React components
 - Frontmatter‑driven metadata for SEO and organization

2. Project Gallery
- Consistent MDX template featuring overview, tools, challenges, and solutions

3. Resume Page
- Structured, printable layout for work experience, education, and skills

4. Newsletter Integration
- Form validation, success/error feedback, and secure email delivery via Resend

5. Performance Optimizations
- Static generation for most pages
- Dynamic imports and code splitting
- Next.js Image optimization
- Caching headers for assets


## Deployment & Domain
- Continuous Deployment: Every push to main triggers a Vercel build and deploy
- Custom Domain: Configured ziadtamim.com with DNS and SSL via Vercel

## Results
- Performance: Consistently scores above 95 on Lighthouse
- Responsiveness: Fluid layouts and scalable typography across all devices
- Maintainability: Modular MDX structure makes it straightforward to add new posts or projects
