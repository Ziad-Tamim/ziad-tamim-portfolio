## MueenCVs â€“ AI-Powered CV & Cover Letter Generator

**MueenCVs** is a smart, AI-powered web application designed to help users generate personalized, professional CVs and cover letters tailored to any job in seconds. It uses LLMs to analyze job descriptions and optimize CV content â€” making job applications faster, smarter, and more effective.

### About the Product
The idea came while I was learning **Next.js** and **LLMs**, and applying for jobs myself. I often had to edit my CV and write new cover letters for each role, which was time-consuming and repetitive. So I built a tool to solve that â€” first for myself, then opened it to the public.
